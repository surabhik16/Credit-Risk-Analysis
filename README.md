German Credit Risk Analysis

When a company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. This is based on the applicant’s profile

A credit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments.

There are two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is a good credit risk, i.e. is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person results in a loss of business to the bank

If the applicant is a bad credit risk, i.e. is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan to the person results in a financial loss to the bank

It may be assumed that the second risk is a greater risk, as the loss includes the prinicple amount as well.

So it is very crucial for a company to evaluate the risks associated with lending money to a customer.

In this project, we will compare the performance of various classification models like Logistic Regression using Step AIC, BIC, LASSSO variable selection, Decision Tree on predicting the risk of the loans for 1000 individuals.
